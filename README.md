# gravity_board_game
A simple board game created using C++

This is a simple board game similar to tic tac toe.
Gravity can only be played by 2 players.
Gravity board has 7 rows and 7 columns.
However, players can only start with the last row.
This is because the value put by each players (either X or O) 
 cannot stay in any square with a blank square below it due to "GRAVITY".
The player who manage to plot 4 consecutive X or O vertically, horizontally or diagonally is the winner.

Note:
  X is allotted to player1 and O is allotted to player2 only.
